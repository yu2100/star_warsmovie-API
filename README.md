Routing in React

The App Development company you work with was recently awarded a contract to build applications for the Star Wars franchise.
As a result of the fantastic work you did for the project's first phase, your Team Lead assigned you a list of new features the client wants to add to the Starwars website you built earlier. 

Feature Requirements
When a user clicks on the Read more link on any particular Star Wars movie, it should navigate the user to a page that displays details of that movie 
The details page should have a Back To List Link that takes the user back to the StarWars Homepage
The details page is expected to look like this: https://finmavis.github.io/swapi-task/movie/1
Here is the link to the Star Wars Data API containing the data you need to fetch
https://swapi.dev/api/films
